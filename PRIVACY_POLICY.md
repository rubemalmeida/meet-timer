*Last updated: August 7, 2025*

## Introduction

Google Meet Timer ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Google Meet Timer browser extension (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data We Collect

Our extension collects and stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Timer Settings**: Your preferred meeting duration settings
- **Timer State**: Current timer status (running, paused, or stopped)
- **Visibility Preferences**: Your choices for where to display the timer (Meet vs Slides)

### How We Use This Data

All data is used solely to:
- Maintain your timer preferences across browser sessions
- Provide consistent timer functionality
- Remember your display preferences

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's local storage API
- **No Server Communication**: We do not send any data to external servers
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect usage analytics or tracking data
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or any personally identifiable information

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. All data remains on your local device.

## Permissions

Our extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To interact with Google Meet and Google Slides pages
- **scripting**: To inject the timer display into web pages
- **storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **Host permissions for Google domains**: To function on Google Meet and Google Slides

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Data is protected by your browser's security measures
- We cannot access your data remotely
- Data is automatically deleted if you uninstall the extension

## Your Rights

You can:
- Clear all extension data by resetting the timer
- Remove all data by uninstalling the extension
- View stored data through Chrome's developer tools (chrome://extensions)

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal data at all, this is not a concern for our extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
